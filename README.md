# flask-easy-shop

Actually, a project created for fun and learning. This is my experience of wirking with Flask. Therefore, it has a lot of crutches and bad practices.
While surfing around Codepen I came across interesting Neo-brutalism store template, and I was inspired to code an admin to dynamically add products. (so, index.html and index.css aren't mine)

For a better user experience, I recommend at least changing the link from a "Contact" button to a link to your Telegram bot with a shopping cart and other store stuff.
But for the best user experiece, I recommend to additionally coding cart and payment system integration (for digital goods) or cart, user profile, payment system integration.
